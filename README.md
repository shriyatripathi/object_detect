# Drowsiness Detection using YOLO, Pytorch and Python
-Detect Objects from Images<br/>
-Detect Objects from Pre-Recorded Videos<br/>
-Detect Objects in Real Time Using OpenCV<br/>
-Fine Tuning a Drowsiness Model using YOLOv5 and PyTorch<br/>
-Perform Real-Time Drowsiness Detection<br/>

USE CASES:
1. Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS): The model can be integrated into DMS applications to detect drowsiness in drivers.<br/>
2. Workplace Safety: The model can be deployed in industries where worker fatigue poses risks, such as transportation, manufacturing, or healthcare.<br/>
3. Aviation Safety: Pilots often face long hours of concentration and fatigue during flights. <br/>
4. Security Systems: The model can be employed in security surveillance systems to detect drowsiness in personnel responsible for monitoring surveillance feeds. <br/>
5. Healthcare Applications: The drowsiness detection model can be integrated into healthcare settings, such as hospitals or long-term care facilities. It can assist in monitoring patients' drowsiness levels, especially those undergoing specific medical procedures or taking sedative medications.
