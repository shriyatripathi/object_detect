# Drowsiness Detection using YOLO, Pytorch and Python
-Detect Objects from Images
-Detect Objects from Pre-Recorded Videos
-Detect Objects in Real Time Using OpenCV
-Fine Tuning a Drowsiness Model using YOLOv5 and PyTorch
-Perform Real Time Drowsiness Detection

USE CASES:
1.Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS): The model can be integrated into DMS applications to detect drowsiness in drivers.</n>
2.Workplace Safety: The model can be deployed in industries where worker fatigue poses a risk, such as transportation, manufacturing, or healthcare.
3.Aviation Safety: Pilots often face long hours of concentration and fatigue during flights. 
4.Security Systems: The model can be employed in security surveillance systems to detect drowsiness in personnel responsible for monitoring surveillance feeds. 
5.Healthcare Applications: The drowsiness detection model can be integrated into healthcare settings, such as hospitals or long-term care facilities. It can assist in monitoring patients' drowsiness levels, especially those undergoing certain medical procedures or taking sedative medications.
